## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I like the idea of working for an agency. I get bored easily working on the same thing so I think an agency enviroment would fit me best. But I dont know for sure and am willing to work for a company and see if I actually do like it. 

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
I like and come from an art backround, so something with a combined dev/design role would be perfect.
